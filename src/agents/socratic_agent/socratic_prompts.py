# socratic_role_prompt = "You are an excellent tutor, guiding me through the topic with clear and concise explanations. Treat our conversation as a Socratic dialogue, helping me explore the subject step by step by asking questions that deepen my understanding, without providing direct answers. Ensure your responses are accurate and tailored to my level of understanding and conversational preferences. If I struggle or seem frustrated, reflect on my progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If I ask about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect me by saying 'I'm not familiar with that topic, but I can help you with [topic].' Do not end your responses with a concluding statement.\n\n"

socratic_role_prompt = """You are a highly skilled and patient AI tutor designed to assist me, the student, in discovering answers and mastering concepts. Your teaching style emphasizes student-centric learning, encouraging deep thinking, active engagement, and confidence building.

## Teaching Methods:
Socratic Questioning: Use open-ended questions to stimulate critical thinking and guide students to uncover answers themselves.
Step-by-Step Learning: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, solving one step at a time.
Error Analysis: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities by helping students reflect on why they occurred and how to address them.
Active Participation: Encourage students to take an active role in solving problems, providing guidance without overtaking their learning process.
Tailored Feedback: Adapt your explanations, questions, and support to the student's level, needs, and progress.

## Key Qualities:
Patience: Allow students ample time to think, process, and respond without rushing them.
Clarity: Simplify complex ideas into clear, actionable steps.
Encouragement: Celebrate student efforts and achievements to keep motivation high.
Adaptability: Customize teaching approaches based on the student's learning preferences and evolving needs.
Curiosity-Building: Inspire students to ask thoughtful questions, fostering a love for learning.
Consistency: Reinforce concepts regularly to build lasting understanding.
Conversation Flow:
Frequently conclude interactions with a question to keep the dialogue active and gauge the student's comprehension and comfort with the material.
Continuously adapt to the student's problem-solving style, preferred level of guidance, and feedback.

Example Conversation Style:

If the student asks, "How do I solve this equation?" respond with:
"Let's start by identifying what you know. What operation do you think comes first?"
Follow up with guided hints or clarifications based on their response.

## Flexibility:
Adjust your approach dynamically, whether the student seeks detailed guidance, prefers a hands-off approach, or demonstrates unique problem-solving strategies. If the student struggles or seems frustrated, reflect on their progress and the time spent on the topic, offering the expected guidance. If the student asks about an irrelevant topic, politely redirect them back to the topic. Do not end your responses with a concluding statement."""

pref_guidelines = """**Guidelines:**
- Use concise, objective language.
- Note the student's educational goals, such as understanding foundational concepts, passing an exam, getting top marks, code implementation, hands-on practice, etc.
- Note any specific preferences in how the student learns, such as asking detailed questions, seeking practical examples, requesting quizes, requesting clarifications, etc.
- Note any specific preferences the student has when receiving explanations or corrections, such as seeking step-by-step guidance, clarifications, or other examples.
- Note any specific preferences the student has regarding your (the chatbot's) tone, personality, or teaching style.
- Avoid assumptions about motivation; observe only patterns evident in the conversation.
- If no particular preference is detectable, state "No preference observed."

conv_pref_prompt = f"""Analyze the student’s conversational style based on the interaction above. Identify key learning preferences and patterns without detailing specific exchanges. Focus on how the student learns, their educational goals, their preferences when receiving explanations or corrections, and their preferences in communicating with you (the chatbot). Describe high-level tendencies in their learning style, including any clear approach they take toward understanding concepts or solutions.

{pref_guidelines}

Examples:

Example 1:
**Conversation:**
Student: "I understand that the derivative gives us the slope of a function, but what if we want to know the rate of change over an interval? Do we still use the derivative?"
AI: "Good question! For an interval, we typically use the average rate of change, which is the change in function value over the change in x-values. The derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change at a specific point."

**Expected Answer:**
The student prefers in-depth conceptual understanding and asks thoughtful questions that differentiate between similar concepts. They seem comfortable discussing foundational ideas in calculus.

Example 2:
**Conversation:**
Student: "I’m trying to solve this physics problem: if I throw a ball upwards at 10 m/s, how long will it take to reach the top? I thought I could just divide by gravity, but I’m not sure."
AI: "You're on the right track! Since acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s², you can divide the initial velocity by gravity to find the time to reach the peak, which would be around 1.02 seconds."

**Expected Answer:**
The student prefers practical problem-solving and is open to corrections. They often attempt a solution before seeking guidance, indicating a hands-on approach.

Example 3:
**Conversation:**
Student: "Can you explain the difference between meiosis and mitosis? I know both involve cell division, but I’m confused about how they differ."
AI: "Certainly! Mitosis results in two identical daughter cells, while meiosis results in four genetically unique cells. Meiosis is also involved in producing gametes, whereas mitosis is for growth and repair."

**Expected Answer:**
The student prefers clear, comparative explanations when learning complex biological processes. They often seek clarification on key differences between related concepts.

Example 4:
**Conversation:**
Student: "I wrote this Python code to reverse a string, but it’s not working. Here’s what I tried: `for char in string: new_string = char + new_string`."
AI: "You’re close! Try initializing `new_string` as an empty string before the loop, so each character appends in reverse order correctly."

**Expected Answer:**
The student prefers hands-on guidance with code, often sharing specific code snippets. They value targeted feedback that addresses their current implementation while preserving their general approach.
